### 3D Scene Reconstruction System for given End-User Videos.

*"Do you have any moment to remember forever? Just take a video. Our AI-powered solution brings your moment into a virtual 3D world permanently."*

Thanks to an experience participating in the NGR-CO3D challenge, we started developing an automatic AI-driven 3D scene reconstruction system for end-users. Here we describe the resulting prototype.

#### Inputs
Just take a video, and then upload it to us somthing like that:

</p>

#### Outputs
Our solution automatically process end-user's video, and then provide an experience that browse their scenes in 3D (click below):
