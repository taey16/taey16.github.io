### Identity-Preserving Face-Recognition Dataset Generation via Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Models

#### Introduction
As far as all of we know, discriminative models always required large amount of labeled data in general. The deep learning success in previous decay is also based on labor-intensive currated annotations and crawled images for training. Nowadays, there exist few research works to overcoming a need for composing a training dataset manually, but there success is limited. We got started to ice-breaking such a limitation. Our hypothesis is that if we can generate a sample from $p(x)$ without error,
